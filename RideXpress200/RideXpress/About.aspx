                        RideXpress is a carsharing service with multiple locations all across the U.S.A. 
                        that allows people the ability to rent and share vehicles instead of owning one! 
                        Less cars can serve more people cutting down on traffic, parking congestion, and pollution! 
                        <br />
                        With the Automated Car Rental System (ARCS) employees will be able to report and keep track 
                        of all the vehicles in the inventory, while customers will be able to log in at any time to 
                        see what vehicles are available to them! Renting cars are of the past, carsharing is the future!
